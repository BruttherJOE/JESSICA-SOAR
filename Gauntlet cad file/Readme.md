This folder has the cad file for the gauntlet / glove cad file so that we can 3d-print in case need to replace  
  
Some additional notes:  
1. for the wristband file, you need to dip the 3d print into near-boiling hot water to mold the print.  
2. after a minute, You can take the print out with tweezer and wrap it on your hand immediately before it gets hard.  
Thanks
