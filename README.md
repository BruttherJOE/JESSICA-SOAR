# JESSICA-SOAR


Documentation for incoming team, taking over the JESSICA robot arm.

JESSICA is a robot arm that can automatically serve coffee upon activation. 
We are currently adding a manual function, where users can control JESSICA with an EMG myosensor armband as well as flex sensors

Main2020.py is the script that is currently running in the RPI that is in niryo now.

## Simple communication from Arduino Uno to Raspberry Pi:
### Code in Arduino
```
void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop(){
  Serial.println("Hello World!");   
  delay(2000);
}
```
### Python code in RPi:
```
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)
while 1: 
    if(ser.in_waiting >0):
        line = ser.readline()
        print(line)
```
